The datasets library in Python provides a unified API for loading and working with datasets. It supports a wide variety 
of built-in datasets, including popular datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet. To load a built-in dataset, you can
 use the load_dataset() function.
Here's an example of how to load the CIFAR-10 dataset using the datasets library:

from datasets import load_dataset
# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
```{Python}
cifar10 = load_dataset("cifar10")
```
The load_dataset() function returns a DatasetDict object, which contains the dataset in a dictionary format. The Dataset
Dict object has a train key that contains the training data, a test key that contains the test data, and a validation 
key that contains the validation data.
Here's an example of how to access the training data from the DatasetDict object:

# Get the training data
train_data = cifar10["train"]
The train_data object is a Dataset object, which contains the data in a tabular format. The Dataset object has columns for each feature in the dataset. For example, the CIFAR-10 dataset has columns for the image, the label, and the image ID.

Here's an example of how to access the image data from the Dataset object:
# Get the image data
images = train_data["image"]
The images object is a NumPy array that contains the image data. Each image is represented as a 32x32 pixel array of RGB
 values.

The datasets library also provides a number of methods for working with datasets, such as methods for splitting datasets
,shuffling datasets, and batching datasets. For more information on the datasets library, please refer to the official 
documentation.
